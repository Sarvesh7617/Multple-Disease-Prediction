The Multiple Disease Prediction project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of diseases based on medical parameters. The system allows users to input data like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, to assess the risk of various diseases. The model is deployed as a user-friendly web application, providing real-time predictions and personalized health insights.

Features
Predict disease risks based on user input (e.g., heart disease, diabetes).
Personalized health insights and recommendations based on predictions.
Interactive web interface powered by Streamlit for easy data input and result visualization.
Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better understanding of health trends.


Technologies Used
Pandas, Numpy: For data manipulation and processing.
Scikit-learn: For training the machine learning model.
Streamlit: To deploy the model as a web app.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization.
Pickle: For saving and loading the trained model.


Impact
Enables early intervention and proactive healthcare by predicting potential diseases.
Provides easy access to disease predictions and personalized insights through a simple web app.
